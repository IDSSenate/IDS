# Ideal Diplomacy Simulation
IDS is a simulation system, designed by taking Modal United Nations' problems in mind. Its core idea is to create a space where
individuals can think freely to create solutions for making the world a better place.

For this reason, there are no real-life states in IDS. That is, no delegate
represents a state that exists in real-life. This change means that delegates
can defend their own views on the problems they are facing, rather than trying
to defend the views of a state they were randomly assigned. Also for this
reason, we simplified *resolutions*, which we call *laws* by getting rid of
formalities and the arduous process of writing and preparing resolutions and
drafts.

In IDS, the drafting and writing of the laws, purely reside in the office of the
Tribune, this administrative office takes away the responsibility of juggling
with formal language away from the delegates, and pushes them to voice their
opinions.

IDS differs from MUN in many areas, among which are the following:

* Its main goal is to find solutions, not mimicking real-life diplomacy.
* Officals (which are called Magistras in IDS) has strict powers and
  responsibilities
* Simplification (or removal) of most formalities.
* Conflict between resolutions passed from different
  commissions is highly unlikely (Please check the next page.)
