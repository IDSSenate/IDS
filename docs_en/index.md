# Ideal Diplomacy Simulation
IDS is a simulation system, designed by taking Modal United Nations' problems in minds. Its core idea is to create a space where
individuals can think freely to create solutions for making the world a better place.

For this reason, there are no real-life states in IDS. That is, no delegate respresents a state that exists in real-life. This change
means that delegates can defend their own views on the problems they are facing, rather than trying to defend the views of a state
they were randomly assigned. Also for this reason, we simplified *resolutions*, which we call *laws* by getting rid of formalities and writing.

IDS is different from MUN in theese areas:

* Its main goal is to find solutions, not mimicing real-life diplomacy.
* Offices has strict definitions
* Simplification (or removal) of most formalities.
* Conflict between resulutions passed from different commitions is highly unlikely.
