#Administiration of IDS

Administiration of IDS is done via certain laws and people with certain titles. This document aims to explain those rules and titles.

##Magistras
Magistras are people who vields administrative powers, much like chairs in MUN. Magistras are created from titles used in ancient Roman Republic.
Although having much different powers and responsibilites, they fall in either one of the two categoris: Commisions and Senate.
Magistras that are responsible from commisons are: *Consuls*, *Preators*, *Tribunes* ve *Lictors*. Magistras responsible from Senate are:
*Pro-Consuls*, *Quaestors* ve *Tribune Plebis'*. There also exists *Aediles*, best delegates.

Magistra | Duties
---------|--------
Consul| Responsible from seat, recognizes delegates.
Preator | Aids the counsul in his duties. Responsible from order in the commison
Tribune | Responsible for votes, counts the votes, calls the vote if equal
Lictor | Aids the delegates
Pro-Consul | Attends the matters of burocracy and event-wide problems
Questor | Reports to senate in matters of economy
Tribune Plebis | Makes sure no two laws passed from different commisions contradict each other
Aedile | Best delegate from a certain commison.

It is expected from Aediles to take part in future events as magistras according to a system called *Cursus Honorum*.

###Cursus Honorum
Cursus Honorum dictates how an Aedile rises in administrative power. An aedile must prove his/her ability to handle responsibility by holding certain positions in order:
* Lictor/Tribune
* Preator/Consul

Only after proving himself/herself, one can hold positions in Senate.

##Rules
Fundemental rules of the IDS is based arround concepts of equality and free thinking, and are:

1. No debate on local politics and religion.
2. Attendents *must* wear formal clothing.
3. When refeering to themselves in speach, delegates must use first-person plural or third-person singular speech such as "We do not agree" or "US Delegation aproves." This doesn't apply to rhetorical speech, for instance one cannot use "I do not agree" but can use "When your children will grow up." albeit, it is much better if this sentence is constructed as "When this generation's children grow up." rules regarding to rhetorical speech can change from event to event.
4. Anyone who is not a magistra or delegate cannot speak in the chair nor could be recognized by a Consul.
5. Tribune Plebis reads selected laws at the end of the event.
