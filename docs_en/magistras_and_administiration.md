# Administration of the IDS

Certain officials administrate and manage the IDS by following certain rules,
this document's purpose is to explain these "Positions of Power" and rules.

## Magistrae

A Magistra, is a person responsible for the management of an IDS Council. They
are roughly equivalent to the chairs in MUN; their duties and titles are based
on the Roman Republican Officials. Possessing varying degrees of powers and
responsibilities, there are two "distinct" types of Magistrae, the Senetorial
and the Commisional.

Commissional Magistrae manage a commission. A commision consists of a Consul,
a Preator, a Tribune and a Lictor.

Senetorial Magistrae, manage the entire Council, an entire IDS event. the Senate
may consist of numerous, Pro-Consuls, Questors and a Tribune Plebis.

Other than these Magistrae, there also are Aediles.

Magistra | Responsibility and Power
---------|-------------------------
Consul | Decides who holds the floor, and who can speak.
Preator | Helps the Consul by maintaining order, and by making sure the commision doesn't break into Anarchy. In some cases, Preatorship can be combined with Consulship.
Tribune | Counts and manages the voting process, breaks the ties if they happen, and drafts the laws.
Lictor | Helps the delegates, passing notes, making sure everyone has water, etc.
Pro-Consul | Takes the administrative decisions.
Questor | A member of the Senate responsible for finance.
Tribune Plebis | Makes sure no two laws contradict each other.
Aedile | Rough equivalent to the Best Delegate.

### Cursus Honorum

Cursus Honorum is a system that governs how a delagate can rise to Magistral
positions.

When a delegate is elected as an Aedile, it is likely the Pro-Conculs will
keep this in mind when they are looking for Magistrae. An Aedile will generally
first become a Lictor or a Tribune and than a Preator or a Consul.

However, this shouldn't be taken as a guarantee, just like some Aediles does not
wish to become a Magistrae. Senate may not wish to appoint them.

If however, they successfully performs Cursus Honorum's duties and become a
Preator or a Consul, Senate may appoint an ex-Aedile to Senatorial Magistrae.

## Rules

The fundamental rules of IDS are centered around equality and freedom of thought
and are as follows:

1. Religion and Local Politics will not be topics of discussion.
2. Delegates and Magistrae must wear formal attire.
3. When speaking, delegates must use the third person singular pronoun "We", such as *"the Frankish Kingdom does not agree with this statement"*, they must also avoid using the informal you, and refer to their co-delegates with their country name *"the Frankish Kingdom believes the Representative of the United States of Luxembourg is wrong in this matter."*
4. *Only* the people who hold Magistral or Delegational statue can speak in the conference.
