# Formalities and Rules
While we had tried to decrease the number of rules and formalities in the IDS so that
we would avoid the hardships faced by MUN, IDS does have some predefiened rules to avoid confusion.
Even though we do not recommend it, events based on IDS format can add their own rules to the mix.

## On states

1. IDS states must not be identical to a real state in present day.
2. Names of the countries can be derieved from ethnic, cultural, geographic and historical names.

## On speech

1. Right to respond cannot become a conversation
2. When Consul selects a delegate to speek, the consul says: *"Senate recognizes ... delegation"*
3. After ending a speech, delegate says *"... delegation has spoken."*
4. Maximum time of a speech can be limited by the Consul.
5. However, in any case, three for and three against speeches (including the initial speech) must be taken for articles, and one for and one against for ammendments (unless the proposer of the article ammended upon refuses to defend the article).
6. No one who is not a magistra nor a senate member can speak in front of the commission
7. If members of the senate wishes to warn about the format, they cannot speak against/for nor send ammendments to an article and must warn the consul directly.

## On clothing

Each IDS conferance has its own rules on clothing, however formal clothes are reccomended, except if a country has formal clothes other than the widely accepted ones, however, they must report their clothing one week prior to the start of the conferance.

## On language

Although no rules on language currently exist, other than the fact that you are recommended to use formal language. It is expected from Senate and from Delagates to avoid using gender pronouns, the idea behind that is to distance the speakers (the delegates) from actual persons and turn them into countries and ideas.

Same rules apply for German, Norwegian and French version as well as an hypotetical Latin one.
