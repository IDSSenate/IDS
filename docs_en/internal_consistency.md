# Internal Consistency
In the previous docs, whe have explained that the *main* duty of the Tribune Plebis is to to make sure that no two laws passed by two comissions contradicts each other. However, the Tribune Plebius has another - but similar - duty: *Ensuring Chain Consistency*

## Conferance Chains

Multiple IDS conferences, held by the same organization can be linked, if the organizer wishes so. In such cases, Tribune Plebis makes sure that laws from different *conferences* (as well ass commission of a conference) does not contradict each other. For instance `Law A: Prohibits the sale of tobacco` and `Law B: Adds extra taxes on tobacco`, and Law A comes from a conferance in 2017 and B is from a conference from 2018, and if those two conferences are linked, Tribune Plebis vetos the Law B.

Occurences such as these can be avoided by choosing different topics for linked conferences. For instance, if an organization held two conferences one on Immigration and on Single Economic Unit it is unlikely for such vetoes to be necessary.

`NOTE: IDS conferences are not linked by default. If two conferences are linked, it is requiered by the organization that organizes the event to announce that.`

## Cutting Chains

IDS Chains can be cut off by simply not linking another conference to the chain (or suspended to be revived later.). Participents may have trouble dealing with a lot of documents if a chain is longer that three to four conferences
