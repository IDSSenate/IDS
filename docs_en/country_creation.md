# Country Creation

Certain criteria should be followed when creating countries for the IDS.

Property | Explanation
---------|-------------
Country Name | Full name of the country
Government | How is this Country governed, a republic, a kingdom?
Geographical Region | Regions hold by this country

Delegates must apply to the Senate by specifying these properties of their
country, Senate will then review the application and may chose to accept or
decline it.

## Country Name

Delegates may find inspirations from the real life countries, or geographical
regions, they may simply change a countries name slightly, such as the
Kingdom of Britons, which may be a ultra-nationalistic Britain, or maybe,
they may use geographical names, Republic of Alps.

Drawing inspiration from a former Delegate in IDS2017, Delegates may use old
colonial names, such as the Republic of Mittelafrika, Empire of Ceylon, etc.

Some recommendations for country names:

* Kingdom of Franks, Germans and Britons
* French Commune
* People's Republic of Spain
* United States of Luxembourg

## Government

It should be remembered when you submit your government type, this may conflict
with the name of the country quite easily. A country named Anarchist State of
Britain may very well be extremely totalitarian.

## Geographical Region

A country's location is vital to its success, or lack thereof, it should be noted,
although we generally solve locational contradictions before a conference, if you
wish to have a diplomatic quarrel with another nation, and if you both want that,
you can both claim the same region, and than stay cold towards each other.

## Approval or Denial

Senate may chose to approve or deny any application.
