# Speaking and Laws
IDS conferences work similarly to MUN conferances... With some differences.

## Speaking
In IDS, speaking works like as follows:

1. Delegate whom will make an offer is recognized by the Consul
2. Delegate takes the chair.
3. Delagate speaks, by the end of the speech a proposal has been put on the floor.
4. Consul takes a minimal of two for and three against speaches regarding the proposal.
5. During these speeches, a amendment can be given about the proposal.
6. Consul takes at most one against speech against a amendment.
7. If the amendment is accepted and changes made on the original proposal is radical enough - which is determined by the preator. - For and Against speeches on the proposal can be restarted.
8. Concul decides if the speeches are over
9. Before voting, Lictor takes everyone who is *not* a delegate nor a magistra outside the room, and waits outside to avoid anyone to interrupt the voting.
10. Tribune leads the voting and counts the votes.
11. Tribune ends the voting announces the decision.

` Senate can limit the time to speak to at least three minutes for main speeches and one minute for Proposals of Change.`

` When leading the vote, Tribune doesn't have to say A for B against, Tribune can simply say those who whis A/B (depending on the circumstances).`

### Also

* Magistras can't sent messages using lictors to delegates.
* Delegates can open themselves for questions, where delegates can ask questions by taking permission from the consul.
* After asking a question and listening the answer delegate cannot speak again *unless* if the delagete (that answered) said something that gave the *right of reply* to the asker, in which case, the delagate that asked the question *can* speak again.

## Laws

In IDS, resolutions are called *laws* and differs from resolutions in a variety of different ways. Greatest difference is the laws aren't prepared by *writing* rather they are prepared by *speaking and debating* while being written down by Tribune simultaneously.

### Preperation of a Law
` There are no preambulatory clauses in the IDS, the purpose of the Law is the finding a solution to the theme.`

1. Consul, Preator and Tribune determines the theme of the law, for example: Overpopulation, Terorism, Ideal Education.
2. Delegates are given a minimum of five minutes to find clauses.
3. A delegate takes the floor and gives a speach explaining the clause he/she thinks should be in the final law
  - During the speach the delegate must explain his/her clause in a tidy, understandable and short manner.
  - If he/she cannot explain the clause appropriately then the consul might send him/her back to rethink without holding a vote.
4. Consul arguments for and against the clause proposal, if the speaker offers a radical change.
  - Consul asks the speaker if she/he wishes to offer an amendment.
5. Consul takes arguments against and for the amendment.
6. Amendment is voted.
7. After all the arguments and speches are done, the general clause is voted.
8. Accepted clause is added to the law by the Tribune
9. After all the clauses are voted, the law is voted.
10. If the law is accepted, it is sent to Tribune Plebis to be examined and published on the internet

### Writing the Law

Tribune writes the laws. Signatories are the delegates whom has participated in the debates. Here is an example law:

```
Law on Disarmement
Comission: Economic Comission
Signatories: British Republic, Northern Rhine Federation,
Calmarian Commune, Fedareted Republic of Venice

This law has been written to support disarmement in order
to fix the economics costs of wars worldwide.
We had deemed these clauses necesary for this matter:
  1. Countries with military industry to
  redirect their economical resourcers elsewhere
    a. Foundation of an international organization
    to inspect and follow the works on disarmement.
```
This is the bare minimum necesary for a law. As seen in the example, things to keep in mind while writing laws are:

* Avoid unecesarily complicated language that would make it hard for the idea to be understood.
* During the writing don't use figure of speches, be plain and simple.
* Clauses can be explained by sub-clauses (up to three degrees) however this isn't necesary
* There could only be one sub-clause as well

We should also remember:

* If a delagate offers an amendment to his/her own clause, this is not necesarily a bad thing.
* Because solving problems is the essance of IDS, one accepting the flaws of oneself's clause and trying to change that, to fix that and to make a clause to its greatest possible self is really a merit.

When a law is passed, it takes a serial number and published in the IDS archives.
